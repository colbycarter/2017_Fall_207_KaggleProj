"[Request] Brooklyn, NY: Just moved apartments. Exhausted, lonely, and very hungry.","EDIT: TAKEN CARE OF YAY.

Hello lovely Pizza Givers,

I'm a young gal living in Brooklyn, and I just moved from my cozy apartment into a basement room. I'm very sad to have left what was my home, my cat won't come out from under the couch, and moving down four flights of narrow stairs really made my tummy rumble. After paying for a U-haul and a huge load of cleaning supplies, I'm out of disposable income until my next paycheck, but goodness would I love a delicious, cheesy, pipin' hot pizza. 

Thanks to all the kind souls who are putting faith in humanity back into the aether.

LOVE,
T.

P.S. I know this is a blankish account. I'm a lurking sort of lady. If you'd like any further verification from me, I can do that. Also, I'll draw anyone a sketch who asks for one, just for shits and giggles.

P.P.S. OHMYGLOB. The amazing pizzamom gifted me a pizza and I am so very pleased. Expect photos shortly.",True
[REQUEST] All I have is cereal and spoiled milk,"I guess I could just eat the cereal, but that's all I've eaten for days. It's pretty nauseating. I've actually been really down lately because I literally haven't hung out with people in ages. That aside, I don't have a job anymore, and my food supply has gone low. If someone could just buy a pizza for me today, I would honestly appreciate it and spread it out as long as possible. Hopefully things will pick up around late July/August as everyone goes back to school",True

"(Request) Dinner in Pacific, Mo?",Hi everyone. I usually just lurk around reddit and read but I'm here today because I really need help. I usually do ok with bills and food but this month I had some unexpected bills and we are out of food. I posted in food pantry and Assistance but someone told me maybe look here also. I was wondering if someone could help wit maybe a 15 dollar gift card so I can feed the kids tonight. I hate to come here and beg and I probably should have come earlier but I hate hate hate to ask for help. We have a dominos and they have those 5.99 pizzas if you order 3 and I have 4.oo so if someone could help I would be so thankful. I get paid on Monday and I would happily send it back. Thank you for reading.,True

"[REQUEST] Hungry dad with no food in Kent, WA","Hello everyone,

This is my first time here, I have just heard about it and decided to give it a shot since I have little food.

I live in Kent, WA and we just had a really big snowstorm which put my apartment out of power for 5 days, as well as about 400,000 other homes. I have already been struggling and what little food I had frozen has now been spoiled, even the milk in my refridgerator. I live pay check to pay check and I did not anticipate this, I do not even have the money to purchase a gallon of milk.

I was hoping one of the kind souls out there could gift me a pizza that I could enjoy with my son, it would really help so much as all we have is about 6 cup of noodles and 2 boxes of Mac and cheese (with no milk) to make it until payday this Friday.

If somebody could help me out I would be so happy, pizza from anywhere, it doesn't matter... Just something to eat.

I would gladly repay the favor forward when I get paid and gift somebody else in need.

Thank you for listening,
Mikey",True
"[Request] Missouri, USA - Just got off work. I found out today that my wife left me for another guy. I sure could use a pizza","So, I didn't find out my wife was leaving me today, I found that out a couple weeks ago, but, I did find out it was for another guy today. Worst day of my life, and I need something to eat, but I don't feel motivated to do anything, not even cook. I would be appreciative of whomever would like to help me out, and I'll pass it on when I get paid on Thursday.",True
"[Request] Knoxville, TN","Posting here in hopes of pizza. Bit of a story!

Husband works CONSTANTLY to support us. right now I'm 23 weeks pregnant (see r/babybumps) and after moving back into our apartment due to MIL troubles we're broke til next payday. It's my fault that we're broke which is why I'm secretly posting here while husband is at work and cannot see it. Insurance refuses to cover my prenatal now for some reason so our spare food/gas money has gone to those. 

I am out of work sadly (was collecting SSI for my disability but they cut it off as soon as I got pregnant and no one wants to hire a pregnant woman even for a temp :(  )

So just hoping for a meal for when husband comes home from work :(",True
[Request] Los Angeles - Just got two rescue cats back from the vet and I'm broke. Pizza cures all wounds!,"Just rescued two cats (http://imgur.com/fBpUELb) from our neighborhood and brought them in for vaccinations today. I ended up having to empty my bank account (~$200) for the FVRCP shots, parasite tests, exam fees and IV Fluids for one that was dehydrated. They're home now and finally warming up to me! 

I'd love a pizza (and I'm sure they'll be fighting me for it). 

Thanks!",True
"[Request] Household of 4 grew by 2 tonight, pizza maybe? Eldridge, Ia","Hey RAoP, I feel bad even asking for this, but I've ran into a bit of a pinch. I recently lost my job, and my mother and brother-in-law had to come to stay with us until after the holidays due to losing their heat. Unfortunately we don't have the means to feed everyone.

[Request] KY USA - Would love to surprise my son with a pizza tonight,"I hope I posted the title correctly. I've been unemployed for most of the year, and I will be starting a new job in 2 weeks. I'm very excited about this new position, however I won't be receiving my first check for another month. My son has been my rock through it all and he continues to grow into a wonderful young man.

"[Request] Probably a lot of these out there right now, but I'm stuck at my school for Spring Break and the dining halls are closed. A RaoP would be greatly appreciated.","The title pretty much explains it. I live in New York and flying home to CA for the week isn't worth the expensive plane ticket, and my personal income is quite dismal as a college student, so any Spring Break destination is out of the question. I understand that a lot of people are in the same situation and that it probably isn't the best time to ask for help, but I thought might as well try. It would really be appreciated!",True
